/*
  Challenge Description =>

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

var massMark = 78; // kg
var heightMark = 1.69; // meters

var massJohn = 92;
var heightJohn = 1.95;

var BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
var BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn); //27.309968138370508 24.194608809993426

var markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn; // true
console.log("Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? " + markHigherBMI); // true
